1. Open this git repository in Android Studio:
   https://github.com/coljamkop/BluetoothExample
2. Install to Bluetooth capable Android device
3. This will download a zip containing an example Android application I used to
   test my application:
   https://developer.android.com/downloads/samples/BluetoothChat.zip
4. Install this to a separate Android device, using Android Studio.
5. Pair both devices together, ensuring they are the only devices currently
   paired on either device.
6. Open the example test Application on one device (may need to make device
   discoverable via Bluetooth).
7. Open my application on the other device.
8. It should automatically connect.
9. Press the "Scan for Bluetooth Devices".
10. If correctly configured, the test phone should receive a message from the
    other phone (specifically, "Hey bro").
